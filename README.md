# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data by Adam M. Lang
 This project is based on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.
 
In this data analysis we discovered that:  
- Linear regression predictive modeling showed that as registration year increases so does price and power_ps, but odometer_km is inversely related to this as older cars have more miles. 
- The strongest correlation based on Pearson coefficient is registration year and price and this is also significant based on p value. 
- It appears that the more expensive car brands have higher mean mileage and the less expensive car brands have the lower mean mileage. 
- Audi, BMW and Mercedes Benz are more expensive with Audi being the most expensive cars. 
- Ford and Opel are less expensive with Opel being the least expensive. 
- Volkswagen is in between - this may explain its popularity, it may be a 'best of 'both worlds' option. 
- German manufacturers represent four out of the top five brands, almost 50% of the overall listings. 
- Volkswagen is by far the most popular brand, with approximately double the cars for sale of the next two brands combined. 
- The majority of cars were registered around the period of 1999 to 2008. However, the standard deviation was 81 years. 
- Odometer and Price fields on eBay were rounded, which might indicate that sellers had to choose from pre-set options for this field. Additionally, there were more high mileage than low mileage vehicles listed on the site.
